Being honest about my git knowledge:
Despite the fact that i have great experience collaborating on git for assignments, side projects or my startup, i did not know how to resolve conflicts. I think i used to use 50% of the git's capabilities. Now, due to the wonderful assignment of our esteemed Git Expert/Professor/Senior SWE Manolis PAP, i could say with confidence that i could use most of git's capabilities. Thank you dear Manolis. Appreciate it ;).

Interesting fact about me:
Used to be a kick boxing champion, retired, became fat. Now i m comin for ya heads in the startup industry. Be careful.

Also, i am a techno king and house master.
