The tutorial and lab assignment made me realize that, although I thought I was comfortable with Git commands and the GitHub environment, there's still a lot I have to learn. The lab definitely helped me discover and understand new concepts!

Interesting facts about me: 
- I used to play volleyball and beach volleyball, and after stepping away for 2 years, I realize how much Iâ€™ve missed it. 
- I also have to admit, I enjoy playing the intermediary between tech and business teams in projects. I find it rewarding to connect different perspectives and people and not actually diving too deeply into either side.
