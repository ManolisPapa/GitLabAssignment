Improvements:

- Nikos:

Git Knowledge:
- Before: 4/10 — I understood commits and pushing, but barely used branches.
- After: 9/10 — Now I squash, branch, rebase, write good messages, and I’m more confident with workflows.
- Also god, in task 1 I had aborted 4 times and everything vanished(deleted), man that was an adventure.

Fun fact:
I love to cook food, it fills my day and makes me happy, also I stress manage by looking up for crazy offers or discounts.
