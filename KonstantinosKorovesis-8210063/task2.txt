I worked alone, so no partner.
Features I implemented:
1. Add more stock tickers to the list.  #E
4. Show information about the stock (e.g., market cap, P/E ratio) alongside the chart. #M
6. Add a news section to show the latest news related to the selected stock. #H

Before: 7/10. I had a pretty basic idea of a few common git commands.
After: 9/10. I understand how the most commonly used git commands work and feel comfortable using them.
