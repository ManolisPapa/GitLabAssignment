Git knowledge before tutorial:
Basic – I knew git clone, commit, and push, but didn’t use branches or GitHub much.

Git knowledge after tutorial:
Better – I can now use branches, resolve merge conflicts, squash commits and collaborate using GitHub.

Something fun or interesting about me:
I do parkour and work sometimes as a stunt woman.
