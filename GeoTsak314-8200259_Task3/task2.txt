[Task2](https://github.com/GeoTsak314/SEIP_Lab3_Git/tree/main/Task2)

Partner: 
Since most of the parts of my team are already in AUEB Practice mode... I did these tasks solo! 

Improvements:
- #E: Added more stock tickers 
- #H: Portfolio tracker
- #H: News section (and a fix to not throw empty news feeds)


Git knowledge:
Before tutorial = around 8 (to be honest, I mostly use Github Desktop)
After tutorial = around 9 (I show some extra commands, but still need to check the full github functionality)


Fun fact:
I always try to use interesting (mostly funny) images at the end of my AUEB presentations! 
Spin for Spinelis!
