I did the task together with Diana Scharbl (DJ0409 on GitHub), we split the different tasks like this:
1. Easy - Diana
2. Easy - Frida 
3. Medium - Diana
4. Medium - Frida
5. Hard - Diana
6. Hard - Frida


I would rate my knowledge to git a 7/10 

Something fun about me is that i have broken my nose twice 👎🏼
